Adding EIPs to a Shared Bandwidth
=================================

Scenarios
---------

Add EIPs to a shared bandwidth and the EIPs can then share that bandwidth. You can add multiple EIPs to a shared bandwidth at the same time.

Notes and Constraints
---------------------

-  After an EIP is added to a shared bandwidth, the original bandwidth used by the EIP will become invalid and the EIP will start to use the shared bandwidth.
-  The EIP's original dedicated bandwidth will be deleted.

Procedure
---------

2. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.
3. On the console homepage, under **Network**, click **Elastic IP**.
4. In the navigation pane on the left, choose **Elastic IP and Bandwidth** > **Shared Bandwidths**.
5. In the shared bandwidth list, locate the row that contains the shared bandwidth to which you want to add EIPs. In the **Operation** column, choose **More** > **Add EIP**, and select the EIPs to be added.
