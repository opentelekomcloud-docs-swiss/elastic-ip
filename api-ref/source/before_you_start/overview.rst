Overview
========

Welcome to *Elastic IP API Reference*. The EIP service provides independent public IP addresses and bandwidth for Internet access. EIPs can be bound to or unbound from ECSs, virtual IP addresses, NAT gateways, or load balancers. Various billing modes are provided to meet diverse service requirements.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on EIPs, such as creating, querying, deleting, and updating an EIP. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <eip_api02_0001>`.

If you plan to access EIPs through an API, ensure that you are familiar with EIP concepts. For details, see "Service Overview" in the *Elastic IP User Guide*.
