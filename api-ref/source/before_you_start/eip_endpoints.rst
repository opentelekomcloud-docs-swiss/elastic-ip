EIP Endpoints
=============

An endpoint is the **request address** for calling an API. Endpoints vary depending on services and regions. Currently, EIP and VPC use same endpoints. For the endpoints of all services, see `Regions and Endpoints <https://docs.sc.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__.
